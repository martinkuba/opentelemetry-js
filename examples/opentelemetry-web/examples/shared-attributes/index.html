  <p>
  This example shows the usage of shared attributes. There are two types of attributes - global and trace-context-based.
  Global attributes are applied to all spans and logs, which means that spans in different traces will receive the same global attributes.
  Examples of global attributes are session ID or the current URL.
  </p>

  <p>
  Trace-context attributes are applied to spans and logs that belong to the same trace. An example of such attribute would be
  an identifier of the user interaction that started the trace.
  </p>

  <p>
  The `session.id` attribute is set at the beginning when the app initializes, and the value is included on all spans and logs.
  </p>

  <p>
  The `page.url` attribute is set at the beginning, and can also be changed by clicking the `Change URL` button.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Clicking the Test button will generate a single event (log record) and a trace with two spans. All these three signals will have
  the same session.id, pageUrl and element attributes added to them.
